CORAIN is constructed to encode RNA of **(1) providing various coding strategies for RNA from three perspectives, sequence, structure and physical chemical properties, (2) offering the combined coding strategies of RNA-RNA interaction, RNA-protein interaction and RNA-drug interaction, (3) covering the encoding methods not only for conventional machine learning but also the deep learning**. Therefore, users can get the encoding results of RNA or the encoding results of RNA interaction pairs from CORAIN, which can be directly used for artificial intelligence.
